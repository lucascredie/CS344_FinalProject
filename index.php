    The WSU Student Green Fee (SGF) provides funding for projects that promote environmental 
    sustainability and enhance the student experience at WSU.  SGF funding will be allocated 
    to projects that increase the use of renewable energy on campus and/or in the local 
    community, increase the energy efficiency of our facilities, reduce the amount of waste 
    created and material resources used on campus, encourage sustainable behaviors, and 
    integrate sustainability into teaching, research, operations, buildings and grounds 
    management at WSU.  The All-University Sustainability Committee administers the SGF.
